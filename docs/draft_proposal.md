# Capstone Project Data Science 606 
##### Proposal By : Sushanthik Reddy Poreddy
### Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

#### Issue of interest
In the present world we do see people of different ages keep on running behind the money and they neglect their health. But the past few years had meade the people to think of their health rather than the money. During the COVID period we had seen many people loosing their life due to lack of proper immunity. In olden days only certain age of people above 60's used to have heart diseases but now the situation has completely changed. Their are many cases where the people between age group 25-30 had lost their life due to heart diseases. The reason that made me to choose this project is it is very important to identify the chance of such heart diseases and take appropriate precautions.
